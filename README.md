# 🎵 Decentralized Music Collectibles Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that empowers independent musicians to release limited-edition music NFTs, ensuring fair royalties, anti-piracy protection, and direct fan engagement! This project addresses real-world problems in the music industry, such as unfair revenue distribution from streaming platforms, lack of ownership proof for digital tracks, and limited fan interaction. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, artists can mint scarce digital collectibles (e.g., exclusive tracks, albums, or remixes as NFTs), automate royalty payouts, and build community-driven experiences—all while fans own verifiable, tradable assets.

## ✨ Features

🎼 Mint limited-edition music NFTs with embedded metadata (e.g., track details, artwork, and audio previews)  
💰 Automatic royalty distribution to artists, collaborators, and even fans on secondary sales  
🛡️ Anti-piracy verification through immutable hashes and ownership proofs  
🗳️ Fan governance for voting on exclusive releases or artist decisions  
🏪 Built-in marketplace for buying, selling, and auctioning NFTs  
🔒 Exclusive content unlocks for NFT holders (e.g., access to unreleased demos)  
📊 Staking rewards for long-term holders to earn artist-branded tokens  
🔄 Fractional ownership for high-value collectibles, enabling shared investments  
📈 Analytics dashboard for tracking sales and engagement (on-chain queries)  
🚫 Dispute resolution mechanism to handle ownership claims

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a robust ecosystem. Here's a high-level overview of the contracts and their roles:

1. **NFT-Contract**: Core SIP-009 compliant NFT for minting and transferring music collectibles. Handles unique token IDs, metadata storage, and transfer restrictions.
2. **Royalty-Contract**: Manages automated royalty splits (e.g., 10% to artist on resales). Tracks beneficiaries and enforces payouts via post-conditions.
3. **Marketplace-Contract**: Facilitates listings, bids, and sales of NFTs. Includes fixed-price sales and escrow for secure trades.
4. **Auction-Contract**: Runs timed auctions for limited-edition drops, with bidding logic and winner determination.
5. **Governance-Contract**: Enables DAO-style voting for NFT holders. Uses token-weighted votes for proposals like new releases.
6. **Staking-Contract**: Allows holders to stake NFTs for rewards in a fungible token (e.g., artist fan tokens).
7. **Fractional-Ownership-Contract**: Splits NFTs into fractional tokens (SIP-010 compliant) for shared ownership and liquidity.
8. **Verification-Contract**: Stores hashes of music files for piracy checks and provides ownership verification functions.

**For Musicians (Artists)**

- Upload your music file and generate a SHA-256 hash off-chain.
- Call the `mint-nft` function in NFT-Contract with the hash, title, description, edition limit (e.g., 100 copies), and royalty splits.
- Set up an auction via Auction-Contract or list directly on Marketplace-Contract.
- Use Governance-Contract to propose fan votes on bonus content.
- Royalties are automatically distributed on every sale through Royalty-Contract.

Boom! Your limited-edition track is now a verifiable NFT, with built-in earnings and community tools.

**For Fans (Collectors)**

- Browse and buy NFTs via Marketplace-Contract or bid in Auction-Contract.
- Verify authenticity using Verification-Contract's `check-ownership` or `validate-hash` functions.
- Stake your NFT in Staking-Contract to earn rewards.
- Participate in votes through Governance-Contract to influence artist decisions.
- Unlock exclusive content by proving ownership (e.g., query NFT-Contract for holder perks).

**For Verifiers or Collaborators**

- Use Verification-Contract to confirm a track's hash matches the original and check registration timestamp.
- Query Royalty-Contract for payout history to ensure fair distribution.
- In case of disputes, invoke Governance-Contract for community resolution.

That's it! A seamless, decentralized way to collect, trade, and engage with music while solving industry pain points like revenue leaks and fan disconnection. Deploy on Stacks for Bitcoin-secured transactions!
